/*
 * Created by: Prem Patel
 * Purpose: Calculates the final weighted grade in a class. 
 * 			If the final has not been taken, the program will output the lowest score a student can score on a final to earn their desired grade as a final grade.
 * 			If the final was taken, the program calculates the final grade of the course.
